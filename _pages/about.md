Hi! I’m **Amir Aynede**, currently pursuing a Master’s in Bioinformatics at the University of Bologna.

My journey into bioinformatics began with a deep curiosity about how computational tools can help us better understand diseases, particularly cancer. Over time, I’ve grown passionate about applying machine learning to biological data, building reproducible research workflows, and making scientific insights more accessible.

Outside academics, I enjoy exploring nature, listening to music, and sharing ideas with researchers and developers.

Feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amir-aynede-b76840169/) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmirAynede).
