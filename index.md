I’m **Amir Aynede**, a Master’s student in Bioinformatics at the Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FaBiT), Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna, Italy.

My academic background and research interests lie at the intersection of biology and computation, with a particular focus on:

- **Computational Biology and Structural Bioinformatics**  
- **Cancer Clinical Data Bioinformatics**  
- **Machine Learning Applications in Diseases**

My work integrates data science, biological insights, and modern AI to explore complex biomedical problems, especially in the context of cancer research.

You can explore a collection of my recent and ongoing projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AmirAynede), each accompanied by detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility — including code, notebooks, reports, and automated workflows.

One of my most recent and comprehensive works is a machine learning pipeline for cancer classification using histopathological images from the LC25000 dataset. The goal of this project was to automate cancer subtype classification using deep learning — addressing limitations of manual histopathology such as subjectivity and variability across human observers.

The pipeline encompasses all stages of a modern AI project: data preprocessing, training a fine-tuned ResNet18 model, model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and interpretability using Grad-CAM to visualize decision-relevant regions of images.

This project reflects both the technical depth and the scientific purpose that guide my work in biomedical informatics.
