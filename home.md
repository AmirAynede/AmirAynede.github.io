I am a Master’s student in Bioinformatics at the Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FaBiT), Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna, Italy.

My academic background and research interests lie at the intersection of biology and computation, with a particular focus on:

- **Computational Biology and Structural Bioinformatics**
- **Cancer Clinical Data Bioinformatics**
- **Machine Learning Applications in Diseases**

My work integrates data science, biological insights, and modern AI to explore complex biomedical problems, especially in the context of cancer research.

You can explore a collection of my recent and ongoing projects on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AmirAynede), each accompanied by detailed documentation to ensure full reproducibility. You can find all the detailed steps on my GitHub repository, including code, notebooks, reports, and automated workflows.

One of my most recent and comprehensive works is a **machine learning pipeline for cancer classification** using histopathological images from the LC25000 dataset. The goal of this project was to automate cancer subtype classification using deep learning — addressing limitations of manual histopathology such as subjectivity and variability across human observers.

The pipeline encompasses all stages of a modern AI project: data preprocessing, training a fine-tuned **ResNet18 model**, model evaluation using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, as well as interpretability techniques such as **Grad-CAM visualizations** to highlight decision-relevant image regions.

This project not only demonstrates the technical steps for building reproducible ML pipelines but also reflects my commitment to **transparent, accessible research in biomedical informatics**.
